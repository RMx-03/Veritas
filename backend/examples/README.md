# Examples & Legacy Utilities

This folder contains non-essential example/demo helpers kept out of the core runtime:

- `sample_data.py` – mock analysis payloads and sample nutrition label text.
- `demo_endpoint.py` – FastAPI router for returning mock responses (not mounted by default).

You can delete this directory in production deployments to slim the image.
